# Live Score App

A white-labeled live score app that can be used to tailor all most all types of sporting events. Built using Firebase and Flutter & other dart based technologies.

## Components

1. **Core** - Responsible for all the functionality (where magic happens).
2. **Dashboard** - A dashboard + server for managing the whole system (can be hosted in Firebase Hosting).
3. **Mobile** - Mobile app clients (where all the fancy stuff happens, on your phone).
4. **Web** - Web app clients (Again, where all the fancy stuff happens, but this time in a browser).
